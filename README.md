# Hello!

I made this repository to store some useful OPA policies that can be used in Backstage (if you are using the OPA Backstage plugins I am making).

## What plugins?

You can find the backend plugins [OPA Backend](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/brewed-backstage/tree/main/plugins/opa-backend) and the [OPA Permissions Wrapper](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/brewed-backstage/tree/main/plugins/opa-permissions-wrapper).

And also for the [OPA Entity Checker](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/brewed-backstage/tree/main/plugins/opa-entity-checker) plugin

## Note

This is all very much work in progress! As I go I will add more policies and try to make them more clear and concise. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please let me know!
