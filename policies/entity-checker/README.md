# Entity Checker Policies

This policy (and policies to come) are meant to be used with the [OPA Entity Checker](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/brewed-backstage/tree/main/plugins/opa-entity-checker) plugin.

They are designed to be used as "nagging" policies that will display on entities that are not compliant with the policy.
